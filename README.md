## Neighborhood Map
This project integrates the Google Map and Foursquare API's, uses Knockout for the MVVM and jquery for AJAX calls (and errors). Grunt modules were used for production processes, including css, html and javascript minification and image compression.

####How to use 
Click on any marker on the google map, and relevant data will appear in the right side panel. The left panel contains the list of all markers on the map, with a drop-down menu to filter based on type of marker location. This list panel will collapse when on mobile, and is replaced by a 'hamburger' drop-down menu.
